# Incredible: Challenge your assumptions about news sources you trust
This is a prototype built during the [2017 ISOJ hackathon](https://github.com/AndrewGibson27/news-credibility-hackathon), hosted by Hackastory in Austin, Texas.

The quality/stability of the code is about what you'd expect for something built in less than eight hours. That said, do `npm run dev` and then visit `/preferences` if you want to give it a whirl.
